# What is React Native?

React Native is an open source framework developed by Facebook which enables developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using Javascript. With React Native, one can develop a mobile application by using the same design principles used to develop a web application with ReactJs framework. It allows the developer to build mobile application UI by composing multiple components in a declarative way. Before React native, there were few options like Cordova, ionic available to build a hybrid application. 

These applications were written using web technology but the hybrid app was not a native application and lacks performance issue. React native solves those performance issues that is why it quickly became popular in React community. Under the hood, React native bridge invokes the native rendering APIs in Objective-C (for IOS) and Java (for Android). That is why they perform better than hybrid application development frameworks. React native has a very good community of developers who actively contribute to the framework. Its code is available on Github and has 70k+ stars.

# What are the benefits of using React Native for building mobile applications?

There are following benefits of using React Native in mobile application development

    React Native enables a web developer to build mobile apps with Javascript.
    The developer doesn’t need to learn complete new programming language java/ Kotlin to develop Android App. Similarly, the developer doesn’t need to be an expert in objective C or swift to develop IOS app anymore. Javascript is more than sufficient to build a mobile app for both Android and IOS. However, knowing java or swift helps the developer to write performance robust mobile app.
    With React Native, most of the code base can be shared between the Android app and the IOS app.
    With a single code base, effort in maintenance is reduced by many folds.
    With a single code base, features can be shipped much faster on both major mobile platform
    Developer having experience with ReactJs can quickly learn React Native. The learning curve for a developer is very low.
    App developed with React Native is not a web app running inside a mobile app. It is a real mobile app because it uses the same fundamental building blocks as regular IOS native app and Android app uses.
    React Native lets you build an app faster as it’s tool gives hot reloading functionality out of the box which means we don’t need to recompile app again and again on making changes.
    React Native gives the flexibility to use Native swift or java module with React Native application. So your app can get the best from both worlds.
