# Getting Started


Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

npm install -g expo-cli

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start

This will start a development server for you.
